Description: 
1. Designed the pages using Next.js as like as the provided figma

2. Server side is made by Typescript and Node.js for explicitly type checking.

3. Implemented browser storage for (e.g. localStorage) for data of the field of page 1. When the user write something and after that if he/she goes away the data will be saved to the input field and give the user better experience. When the user returns to the page user can continue from he/she was.


3. I have used a third party tool for storing the image the use upload. And it's imagebb. The hosted link is being saved to the database(mongodb). I have used mongoose for extra validations.

4. Used custom CSS for designing and some kinds of effects like hover and more. Also used Tailwind CSS as css library as I prefer.

5. Created a project structure that follows best practices and is well-organized. You can find on the github repo.

6. The provided backend APIs were integrated successfully by asynchronously because I have used Node.js as backend programming language. I have also handled the errors as well as request and response. 

7. Reusable components made for further use.

Implement Redux for state management.
Prototype and design the exact flow for OTP entry. This should include a smooth user experience and error handling.
